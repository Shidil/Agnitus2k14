		<description>
			Engineering is the branch of science that deals with creating shortcuts for the laziest of living beings -the humans!!
			Man, from the time wheel was invented, is trying to simplify efforts to accomplish a task. Their quest for the same has led to invention of robots. We at Agnitus salute this laziness that has led to many inventions that make our life convenient!!! So, it’s time to create your own bot to help you in a pick and place task.

[b]Problem Statement[/b]
With the aid of an autonomous or remote controlled (could be wired) machine, pick the blocks given, carry and place it at the destination within the specified arena in the shortest span of time.
[b]Block Specification[/b]
There will be 10 cylindrical wooden blocks, each having a base diameter of 4 cm and height 8 cm, and an approximate weight of 150 g (within 10% error). All blocks will have a metallic semi-circular ring (of non-magnetic material) on the top. 
[b]Robot Specifications[/b]
[li]	The machine must fit in a box of dimension 0.35m x0.25m x 0.5m.[/li]
[li]	The dimension constraints mentioned above are only for machines and does not include external wired/wireless remote control or external power source.[/li]
[li]	Machines can expand or detach into multiple parts, provided it does not damage the arena in any way. Machines will be disqualified if they damage the arena.[/li]
[li]	The machine should not have been constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade mechanism. However, the use of readymade gear assemblies is permitted. Violation of this clause will lead to disqualification.[/li]
[br/][b]Robot Propulsion[/b]
	The machines can use external or on-board electric or non-electric power sources. Use of compressors is not allowed. The power supply must be non-polluting and must comply with the safety standards set by the judges. If a non-electric power source is used, kindly get the approval of the organizers by e-mail.[br/] 
The following e-mail address may be used for the same: agnitus2k14@gmail.com[br/] 
Organizers are not responsible for inconvenience caused if approval is not sought.[br/] 
	The method of propulsion is at the discretion of the builder, provided it does not damage the arena and satisfies the safety constraints set by the judges.[br/] 
	In case of electric power supply, the voltage at any point on the machine must be lower than or equal to 12V.[br/] 
The organizers will provide a standard 12V, 1A DC power supply. Any extension cords, eliminators, adaptors etc. required should be arranged by the participants themselves.[br/] 
[b]Robot Controls[/b]
	The machine has to be necessarily controlled by some wired/wireless remote control mechanism at all stages of the game.[/br]
	In case of wired mechanism, the wire must be slack at any point of time during the game. The total length of wire extending from the remote control to the machine must be aminimum of 3 meters.[/br]
	If the Machine is using an external wireless remote control, make sure that it has sufficient range, and that it can control the machine well without any lag.[/br]
