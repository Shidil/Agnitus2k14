		<rules>
[li]	Participation can be as an individual or as a team comprising a maximum of 4 members. All participants must carry a valid college identity card.[br/]
[li]	The robot has to be developed and designed by the team itself. The usage of commercially available modules is allowed, but it is forbidden to use a complete robotic-system which is sold ready for the purpose of the competition. At least the software-development should show significant personal effort. [br/]
[li]The robot must fit on an A4 piece of paper. There is no weight limitation. Robots must have passed inspection prior to competing. [br/]
[li]The time of any run is measured from the instant the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when any wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line. [br/]
[li]Energy sources like springs, compressed-air, batteries, etc. are permitted. Combustion engine powered bots are not allowed. [br/]
[li]The robot has to have an easily reachable emergency stop button which interrupts the power supply of the actuators. On demand of the jury or in imminent danger, a team member has to stop the robot immediately. [br/]
[li]Timekeeping: time shall be measured by an electronic gate system or by a judge with a stopwatch, based on the availability of equipment. In either case the recorded time shall be final. [br/]
[li]Robots have to operate autonomously and may not be remote-controlled. All systems (like sensors, power supply, data-processing and control-systems) have to completely reside on the robot. [br/]
[li]A robot that wanders off of the arena surface will be disqualified. A robot shall be deemed to have left the arena when any wheel, leg, or track has moved completely off the arena surface. [br/]
[li]Losing the Line: any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point. [br/]
[li]Robots have to stay on the ground. They may not fly or jump. [br/]

[li]Robots must not damage the tournament area. [/li][br/]
[li]All kinds of weapons (saws, lasers, electroshocks, hammer) are strictly forbidden. [/li][br/]
[li]Claims because of changing lighting conditions in the room or flash lights of photographers won't be accepted. Participants have to face these "disturbances". [/li][br/]
[li]Equipment which harms or disturbs another robot (e.g. jammer, light flash, interfering ultrasonic or infrared transmitter) are forbidden. Disturbances or assistance caused by intervention of humans during a competition are forbidden, as well. [/li][br/]
[li]The decision of the judging panel will be final and binding.[/li][br/]
[li]Team Agnitus has the rights to change or modify the above rules as deemed required. Changes, if any will be updated in the website. [/li]

		[b]Judging:[/b][br/]
[li]1.	Scores are awarded on the basis of speed, efficiency of maze solving, and self-reliance of the mouse bot.[/li]
[li]2.	The total sores can be computed as: [br/]
[50/T1]+[200/T2]-E-10P where T1 is time taken to reach the destination, T2 is the return time, E is the number of errors committed by the bot while returning and P is the touch penalty for manual assistance. [/li]
[li]3.	Three teams with the highest scores will be declared winners.[/li]
[li]4.	The judges have the right to ask the operators to explain the functioning of the mouse.[/li]
