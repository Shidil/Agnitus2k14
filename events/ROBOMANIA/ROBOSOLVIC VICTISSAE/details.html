		So here you go! The line tracer is here!! For all of you who believe moving in the straight path is boringâ€¦we challenge you to create a bot that will navigate through anything that we put in its way!!!
Sample Arena
[b]
SPECIFICATION OF THE ROBOT[/b]
Weight: 10kg 
Dimensions (l*b*h):50cm x 50cm x 40cm
Power supply: 24 Volts
Weight and dimensions of the robot will be measured at the beginning of each match. Tolerance at this stage is 5%
Once the weight and dimensions are noted it will be permanent during the whole tournament.
Changing of motor or other circuit parts will be allowed only if break down occurs. Alteration of shape will not be encouraged.

		<rules>
			Participation can be as an individual or as a team comprising maximum 4 members. All participants must carry a valid college identity card.
			The robot has to be developed and designed by the team itself. The usage of commercially available modules is allowed, but it is forbidden to use a complete robotic-system which is sold ready for the purpose of the competition. At least the software-development should show significant personal effort. 
			The robot must fit on an A4 piece of paper. There is no weight limitation. Robots must have passed inspection prior to competing. 
			The time of any run is measured from the time the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when the forward most wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line. 
			Energy sources like springs, compressed-air, batteries, etc. are permitted. Combustion engines are not allowed because of noise and exhaust gas. 
			Robots have to have an easily reachable emergency stop button which interrupts the power supply of the actuators. On demand of the jury or in imminent danger, a team member has to stop the robot immediately. 
			Timekeeping: time shall be measured by an electronic gate system or by a judge with a stopwatch, based on the availability of equipment. In either case the recorded time shall be final. 
			Robots have to operate autonomously and may not be remote-controlled. All systems (like sensors, power supply, data-processing and control-systems) have to completely reside on the robot. 
			A robot that wanders off of the arena surface will be disqualified. A robot shall be deemed to have left the arena when any wheel, leg, or track has moved completely off the arena surface. 
			Losing the Line: any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point. 
			Robots have to stay on the ground. Thus they may not fly or jump. 

			Robots must not damage the tournament area. 
			All kinds of weapons (saws, lasers, electroshocks, hammer) are strictly forbidden. 
			Claims because of changing lighting conditions in the room or flash lights of photographers won't be accepted. Participants have to face these "disturbances". 
			Equipment which harms or disturbs another robot (e.g. jammer, light flash, interfering ultrasonic or infrared transmitter) are forbidden. Disturbances or assistance caused by intervention of humans during a competition are forbidden, as well. 
			The decision of the judging panel will be final and binding.
			Team Agnitus has the rights to change or modify the above rules as deemed required. Changes, if any will be updated in the website.
