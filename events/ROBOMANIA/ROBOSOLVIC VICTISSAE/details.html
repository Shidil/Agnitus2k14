		<rules>
			•	Participation can be as an individual or as a team comprising a maximum of 4 members. All participants must carry a valid college identity card.[br/]
•	The robot has to be developed and designed by the team itself. The usage of commercially available modules is allowed, but it is forbidden to use a complete robotic-system which is sold ready for the purpose of the competition. At least the software-development should show significant personal effort. [br/]
•	The robot must fit on an A4 piece of paper. There is no weight limitation. Robots must have passed inspection prior to competing. [br/]
•	The time of any run is measured from the instant the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when any wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line. [br/]
•	Energy sources like springs, compressed-air, batteries, etc. are permitted. Combustion engine powered bots are not allowed. [br/]
•	The robot has to have an easily reachable emergency stop button which interrupts the power supply of the actuators. On demand of the jury or in imminent danger, a team member has to stop the robot immediately. [br/]
•	Timekeeping: time shall be measured by an electronic gate system or by a judge with a stopwatch, based on the availability of equipment. In either case the recorded time shall be final. [br/]
•	Robots have to operate autonomously and may not be remote-controlled. All systems (like sensors, power supply, data-processing and control-systems) have to completely reside on the robot. [br/]
•	A robot that wanders off of the arena surface will be disqualified. A robot shall be deemed to have left the arena when any wheel, leg, or track has moved completely off the arena surface. [br/]
•	Losing the Line: any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point. [br/]
•	Robots have to stay on the ground. They may not fly or jump. [br/]

•	Robots must not damage the tournament area. [br/]
•	All kinds of weapons (saws, lasers, electroshocks, hammer) are strictly forbidden. [br/]
•	Claims because of changing lighting conditions in the room or flash lights of photographers won't be accepted. Participants have to face these "disturbances". [br/]
•	Equipment which harms or disturbs another robot (e.g. jammer, light flash, interfering ultrasonic or infrared transmitter) are forbidden. Disturbances or assistance caused by intervention of humans during a competition are forbidden, as well. [br/]
•	The decision of the judging panel will be final and binding.v[br/]
•	Team Agnitus has the rights to change or modify the above rules as deemed required. Changes, if any will be updated in the website.

		[b]Judging:[/b][br/]
1.	Scores are awarded on the basis of speed, efficiency of maze solving, and self-reliance of the mouse bot.
2.	The total sores can be computed as: 
[50/T1]+[200/T2]-E-10P where T1 is time taken to reach the destination, T2 is the return time, E is the number of errors committed by the bot while returning and P is the touch penalty for manual assistance. 
3.	Three teams with the highest scores will be declared winners.
4.	The judges have the right to ask the operators to explain the functioning of the mouse.
