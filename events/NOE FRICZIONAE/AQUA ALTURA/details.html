		JUDGING CRITERIA[/b][br/]
		The event will be held in two rounds-[br/]
Round 1: qualification round[br/]
     - The task is to cover maximum horizontal distance.[br/]
     - The arena will be a 30 degree sector with a straight line cutting it into two halves.[br/]
	 - The place where the tip of the bottle falls will be considered for scoring.[BR/]
     - Two trials will be given to the participants. For this round, the greater of the distances covered in the 2 trials will be considered.[br/]
     
Two trials will be given to the participants. For this round, the greater of the distances covered in the 2 trials will be considered. Participants are allowed to use different rockets for this round.[br/]
      - The teams which successfully cross 50m will be eligible for the finals.[br/]
Qualification round score, Sq= 50(L-50)-30D[br/]
L=distance travelled by the bottle[br/]
D=deviation from centre line[br/]
Final round:[br/]
The task is to hit the bull’s eye of target on an inclined plane to score maximum points.[br/]
The launch point will be 60m away from the centre of the target.[br/]
Three trials will be given to each team and the best score will be considered as final round score.[br/]
The participants are allowed to use different rockets for both the trials.[br/]
The team with the highest score according to the judging criteria will be declared as the winner.[br/]
Final round score, sf =300A[br/]
A= 1 for 5th circle[br/]
2 for 4th circle[br/]
3 for 3rd circle[br/]
4 for 2nd circle[br/]
5 for 1st circle[br/]

Water brought by the team shall not be allowed in the rockets, it shall be provided as well. The amount of water to be filled in the rocket body is left to the choice of the team.[/li]
[li]	The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should not exceed 60 psi.[/li]
[li]	Launchers will NOT be provided by the organizers. Each team must have their own launcher.[/li]
[li]	The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launcher. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other forms of launcher boost assists are forbidden. In other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.[/li]
	[br/]A team can get disqualified if:
[li]Any rocket is found to be dangerous by the organizers and judges.[/li]
[li]A rocket blasts before the launch.[/li]
