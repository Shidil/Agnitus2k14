Use of external components for the same will lead to rejection of the team. Caution money of Rs.100 should be deposited by the teams selected in level I which will be refundable later. Teams should draw the circuit diagram depicting all the principles and theories involved in the circuit as well as the working of the application on a single chart sheet. Submitting the application/kits early will benefit the team as time bonus.After 5 minutes the team member should interchange their position and the team which shows the output at earliest will be judged as winners. Judgments will be based on the following criteria’s.[br/]

1.	Design of the circuit.[br/]
2.	Compactness of the design.[br/]
3.	Efficiency of application.[br/]
4.	Desired output. Exploration of concepts/theories.[br/]
5.	Bread boarding skills/neatness of the implemented circuit.[br/]
6.	Additional functions/options available in the application.[br/]
7.	Contents of chart sheet.[br/]
