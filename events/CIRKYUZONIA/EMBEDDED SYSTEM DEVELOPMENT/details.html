		[b]INTRODUCTION[/b][br/]
		Many technical processes and products in the area of mechanical and 

						electrical engineering show an increasing integration of mechanics with 

						electronics and information processing. The integration between the 

						components and information-driven function, resulting in integrated 

						systems called embedded systems. The stage of Agnitus wants fetch out 

						the system design skill. This event will test both hardware and 

						software skill of the participants.

							Maximum no of members in a team is two.<br>

							There will be an elimination round with objective type questions regarding the event.<br>

							Total duration of event is 1.30 hour with 20min objective and 1hour programming secession<br>

							Participants have to develop both the circuit in proteus and program for the system to be advised to design.<br>
